Knowing Docker
===

This all started with a hope and a dream. Actually, it started because I began
wondering how to get into Open Source. Turns out it is not as easy as it says on
the tin. But what I was missing really was practice and discipline and courage.
I like to step into things knowing as many of things as I should know given people
who I see as peers, or more accurately people who I would like to see as peers.

I started working on a project with an old coworker friend and he used was using
docker. I could always count on him to push me a little bit out of my comfort zone
and towards new things that would challenge me at first but make me a better
developer in the long run.

This repository is a collection of notes I have gathered during my journey of
learning docker. Mostly everything is sourced from the official(lly great) [Docker
User Guide](http://docs.docker.com/userguide).

Enjoy reading. Thanks.
